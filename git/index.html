            To begin with a short story: Not so far from where we are now, there
            was a farmer named Abbaamaccaa Abbaadagaa Abbaalubbuu, also known as
            Abbaamacca Kiiloolee, who had a dream of aviation, perhaps basically
            because of the vast field called Kiiloolee near his house. He sent a
            land rover filled with money to the then king of Ethiopia to help
            purchase an airplane. The king graciously accepted the funds, hosted
            him for couple of days at his palace, and promised that an airplane
            would soon land in Kiiloolee. The plane never arrived to the field,
            however, Abbaamaccaa, who is now very old, worries he may not live
            to see his vision come true. Yet, close to his home, his dream
            continues to take shape, and here we are!The story of another great
            man, a pilot himself, named Mekonnen Bari, perhaps one of the very
            reasons for why we are here today, will also have to be briefly
            narrated here, and will be so by none other than his grandson, Capt.
            Abiy!!
